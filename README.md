#partial-comparison-underscore-lib
This is the frontend project related to https://github.com/slim-hmidi/partial-comparison-underscore-lib.
So in order to visualize the comparison, I tried to create a chart which describes the execution time for the different function implemented.
The x-axis represents the array size.
The y-axis represents the execution time.
To test the project, you can download the zip folder or clone the repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:slim-hmidi/partial-comparison-underscore-lib.git

```
Then run the backend server (click the link mentioned below) which listens on port 3000.
Finally, run the frontend:
```
npm start

```
